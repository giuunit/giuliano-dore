In order to launch this solution, you must have: 

* Node installed on your computer, available here: https://nodejs.org/en/
* Enough space to download packages

Once Node is installed you can run 'npm install' in the folder containing the solution in order to load all the libraries.
You will need to install the following tools globally to render the website: 

* live-server - small http server to render your website: **npm i -g live-server**
* webpack - in order to run the process to convert the js files into a js bundle: **npm i -g webpack**

Once everything is downloaded you can run webpack and let it "watch" code changes using the following command: **npm run build** so the js bundle gets updated automatically. 

In order to render the website you can then use the '**live-server**' command line to display the page on your browser.
